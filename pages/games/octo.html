                The story takes place in Solistia, 
                a land comprising an eastern and western continent divided by the sea. 
                It is a bustling era, wherein large vessels navigate busy sea routes 
                and the power of steam gives birth to new technologies. 
                Some people thrill to glamorous stars of the stage and industry, 
                while others are brought to tears by war, plague, and poverty. 
                In this faraway realm, eight travelers hailing from different regions 
                venture forth for their own reasons. Step into their shoes and explore 
                the land as you see fit, using their unique talents to aid you along your 
                journey. Embark on an adventure all your own.
